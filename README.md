# TubbyCat's Android Security Notes

An array of package lists, debloat scripts and notes for android. 

# Preface

   As it is unfeasible (time, effort) to dump and analyze all packages contained on an android platform, a reduction of Attack-Surface is sought instead. 'Debloating' facilitates a reduction in attack surface by reducing the overall number of packages for which there could exist vulnerabilities. Reducing attack surface alone will not render the device markedly secure. Reducing the sum of potentially vulnerable packages is better than nothing, but not a big something, either.

    Aforesaid measures ought to be paired with prudent user behavior, logging, intrusion-detection (if it exists for android), and ensuring SELinux is enforcing on said device.
